# SOAP over HTTPS with client certificate authentication

```
$ git clone https://github.com/altfatterz/spring-ws-with-keystore
$ cd spring-ws-with-keystore
$ mvn clean package
```

Start the uefa-service with:

```
$ java -jar producer/target/producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=https
```

#### SoapUI

Import the SoapUI project found in the `soapui` folder

Configure the client certificate (found in the `soapui` folder) in the `SoapUI Preferences -> SSL Settings` with `Keystore` field setting to the path of the `soapui.jks` file and `KeyStore Password` setting to `password`

Make a `getTeamRequest` using the example sending the SOAP message to `https://localhost:8443/uefaeuro2016`


#### java client

Start the client with

```
java -jar consumer/target/consumer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

In the output you should see:

```

wss4j 2.0 is different:
[https://ws.apache.org/wss4j/migration/wss4j20.html](https://ws.apache.org/wss4j/migration/wss4j20.html)

There is `SAMLCallback`, the `SAMLIssuer` functionality has been moved to the `SAMLCallback`, so that the CallbackHandler used to create a SAML Assertion is responsible for all of the signing configuration as well.

See config: https://ws.apache.org/wss4j/config.html
